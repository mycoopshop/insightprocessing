All Insight Processing partners have been meticulously hand picked. They all have high caliber references and vast experience, the majority of the partners are ex branch managers who where very successful in their own right before partnering with Insight. We also have three ex-mortgage brokers who ran successful businesses before partnering with Insight because they enjoyed the administration process more than the sales. With this combined experience and expertise it means the Insight group can offer you exceptional executive assistance.&nbsp;</h3>
